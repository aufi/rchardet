# rCharDet

### [Project Page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rchardet) | [1.9 Author](https://github.com/edouard/rchardet) | [Original Author](https://github.com/jmhodges/rchardet)

rCharDet is a character encoding detection library for ruby and the implementation is based
on Mozilla Charset Detectors. 

This is a forked project in a effort to make it Ruby 1.9 compatible

### How do use
    
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'rchardet'

    >> cd = CharDet.detect("some data")
    => {"confidence"=>1.0, "encoding"=>"ascii"}

### How to use - in real life

`detect` takes the variable `data`, that contains some unknown encoding.

We then try to change the encoding to UTF-8 but only if we are at least 60% sure that we found the right encoding.

    data = "Some unknown data"
    cd = CharDet.detect(data)
    data = cd["confidence"] > 0.6 ? Iconv.conv(cd["encoding"], "UTF-8", data) : data
    
### What is being returned?
    
- **encoding** (String) The string encoding
- **confidence** (Float) The confidence level of the *encoding*, from 0 to 1, where 1 is the best.
    
### How do install

    [sudo] gem install rchardet19
